Welcome to the Cornell Cubing Club!

## Mission

We are dedicated to the art and science of speedcubing: solving Rubik's cubes and other twisty puzzles as fast as possible. We can teach everyone new strategies and algorithms, from beginners to experts. Your background should not matter - anyone can learn to cube! Most importantly, our aim is to build up and provide a community for cubers on campus to come together.
